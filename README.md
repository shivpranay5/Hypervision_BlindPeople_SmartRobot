## Project Description

In a world where technology continually reshapes the way we live, robotics stands at the forefront of innovation, particularly in healthcare. **Hyperion** represents a significant leap forward in assistive technology for the visually impaired. Blindness impacts millions globally, creating significant challenges in daily navigation and interaction with the environment. **Hyperion** is our solution—an intelligent, responsive robotic assistant that empowers blind individuals to move confidently through both familiar and unfamiliar spaces.

### Why Hyperion?

Imagine walking blindfolded in your own home—despite knowing your surroundings, a sense of vulnerability is inevitable. Now, extend this scenario to the everyday life of a blind person who must navigate countless unknown environments. This thought has driven us to develop **Hyperion**, a robot designed to be an indispensable guide, offering safety, autonomy, and peace of mind.

**Key Features:**
- **Face Recognition:** Identifies known individuals, providing comfort and safety during interactions.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Detects and navigates around obstacles to prevent collisions.
- **Object Detection:** Recognizes and informs the user of objects in their path.
- **Text Recognition:** Reads out text from signs, labels, and documents.
- **Voice Feedback:** Offers real-time auditory guidance and information.
